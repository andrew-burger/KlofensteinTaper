# KlofensteinTaper
 Klopfenstein Taper Calculation in Python, Julia, and MATLAB.
 
 Calculates the taper length needed for a given return loss.
 
 Samples the continous taper at lambda/2 at Fhigh+Flow in order to keep performance across entire band.
 
 Calculates the performance of the taper given the discretization using ABCD parameters of lossless transmission line and converts into S parameters.
 
 MATLAB script will also export an S2P file.
